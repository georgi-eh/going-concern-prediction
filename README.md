# going_concern_prediction
 The aim of the project is to create a machine learning model which predicts whether a company is going concern (GC) or non-going concern (NGC) based on four input variables (financial coefficients):  NITA (Net Income/Total Assets) QACL (Quick Assets/Current Liabilities) RETA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) TLTA (Total Liabilities/Total Assets) The sample consists of 100 entities operating in the construction sector in Bulgaria. 50% of them are declared bankrupt in 2021 which are representative of NGC companies. 50% of them are with good financial performance. All the necessary data are derived from the Bulgarian Commercial Register. Algorithms applied are na√Øve Bayes classifier, decision tree, neural network and kNN. Additional information about the algorithms is provided in the full paper.
